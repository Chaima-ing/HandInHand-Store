# HandInHand-Store

HandInHand-Store is a full-stack web platform built to support communities in Gaza. It allows users to buy products, bid in auctions, and donate through the profits generated. The project combines a modern React frontend with a Spring Boot backend and integrates with MySQL for data storage.

## Features

* Authentication – User registration and login with secure sessions.
* Online Store – Browse, search, and filter available products.
* Auction Mode – Bid on products in real time.
* Donations – Profits are redirected to charities supporting Gaza.
* Admin Panel – Manage users, products, and auctions.
* Smart Assistant – Guide users on donation and usage (future enhancement).

## Tech Stack

* Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router, TailwindCSS
* Backend: Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Spring Security, Maven
* Database: MySQL
* Tools: Git \& GitHub, Node.js \& npm, IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VSCode

## How It Works

1. Users sign up and log in securely.
2. The storefront displays products (fixed price or auction).
3. Customers can either purchase directly or participate in bidding.
4. Payments go through the integrated payment gateway (e.g., Chargily API).
5. A portion of the profits is automatically redirected to support charities in Gaza.
6. Admins manage users, products, and orders through a dedicated dashboard.

## Future Improvements

* Docker setup for full containerization.
* Mobile-first responsive design.
* AI-powered donation assistant.
* Multi-language support.

## About
