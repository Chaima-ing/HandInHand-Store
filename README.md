HandInHand-Store
 HandInHand-Store is a full-stack web platform built to support communities in Gaza. It allows users
 to buy products, bid in auctions, and donate through the profits generated. The project combines a
 modern React frontend with a Spring Boot backend and integrates with MySQL for data storage.
 Features
 • Authentication – User registration and login with secure sessions.
 • Online Store – Browse, search, and filter available products.
 • Auction Mode – Bid on products in real time.
 • Donations – Profits are redirected to charities supporting Gaza.
 • Admin Panel – Manage users, products, and auctions.
 • Smart Assistant – Guide users on donation and usage (future enhancement).
 Tech Stack
 • Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router, TailwindCSS
 • Backend: Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Spring Security, Maven
 • Database: MySQL
 • Tools: Git & GitHub, Node.js & npm, IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VSCode
 How It Works
 1 Users sign up and log in securely.
 2 The storefront displays products (fixed price or auction).
 3 Customers can either purchase directly or participate in bidding.
 4 Payments go through the integrated payment gateway (e.g., Chargily API).
 5 A portion of the profits is automatically redirected to support charities in Gaza.
 6 Admins manage users, products, and orders through a dedicated dashboard.
 Future Improvements
 • Docker setup for full containerization.
 • Mobile-first responsive design.
 • AI-powered donation assistant.
 • Multi-language support.
